            <h2>Inspiration and themes</h2>
            <p>Paradise Lost is an epic poem by the english poet John Milton. Containing stories about a series of falls, of the angels, of adam and eve, of human language, all of which lead to the corrupt and warlike world that Milton lived in. 
                The epic depicts both Heaven and Hell. And the depictions of Hell, has especially been an inspiration to many an artist. Including that of John Martin. Which has painted such paintings as Pandemonium (depicted below), which depicts the capitol of Hell.
                Milton's paintings such as "The Destruction of Pompeii and Herculaneum" and a few others, are also based on biblical stories.

            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>After his death, Martin's paintings fell out of fashion. And in the early 20th century his paintings went for as little as a pound or two. After the second World War Martin's work got a surge of popularity due to his depictions of apocalypse like material, and today his works go for several thousands.</p>
